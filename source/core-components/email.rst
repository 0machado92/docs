5.4 Email
---------

The emailComponent is a way for you to add simple email sending
functionality to your CakePHP application. Using the same concepts
of layouts and view ctp files to send formated messages as text,
html or both. It supports sending via the built in mail functions
of PHP, via smtp server or a debug mode where it writes the message
out to a session flash message. It supports file attachments and
does some basic header injection checking/ filtering for you. There
is a lot that it doesn't do for you but it will get you started.
