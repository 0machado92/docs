View Extensions ("Helpers")
###########################

A Helper is a class that aids in view logic. Much like a component
used among controllers, helpers allow presentational logic to be
accessed and shared between views. One of the core helpers,
AjaxHelper, makes Ajax requests within views much easier.

Most applications have pieces of view code that are used
repeatedly. CakePHP facilitates view code reuse with layouts and
elements. By default, every view rendered by a controller is placed
inside a layout. Elements are used when small snippets of content
need to be reused in multiple views.
