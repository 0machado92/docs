File and Classname Conventions
###############################

In general, filenames are underscored while classnames are
CamelCased. So if you have a class **MyNiftyClass**, then in Cake,
the file should be named **my\_nifty\_class.php**. Below are
examples of how to name the file for each of the different types of
classes you would typically use in a CakePHP application:


-  The Controller class **KissesAndHugsController** would be found
   in a file named **kisses\_and\_hugs\_controller.php** (notice
   \_controller in the filename)
-  The Component class **MyHandyComponent** would be found in a
   file named **my\_handy.php**
-  The Model class **OptionValue** would be found in a file named
   **option\_value.php**
-  The Behavior class **EspeciallyFunkableBehavior** would be found
   in a file named **especially\_funkable.php**
-  The View class **SuperSimpleView** would be found in a file
   named **super\_simple.php**
-  The Helper class **BestEverHelper** would be found in a file
   named **best\_ever.php**

Each file would be located in or under (can be in a subfolder) the
appropriate folder in your app folder.
