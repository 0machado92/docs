2.1 CakePHP Structure
---------------------

CakePHP features Controller, Model, and View classes, but it also
features some additional classes and objects that make development
in MVC a little quicker and more enjoyable. Components, Behaviors,
and Helpers are classes that provide extensibility and reusability
to quickly add functionality to the base MVC classes in your
applications. Right now weâ€™ll stay at a higher level, so look for
the details on how to use these tools later on.
