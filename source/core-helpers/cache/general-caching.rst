7.2.1 General Caching
---------------------

Caching is intended to be a means of temporary storage to help
reduce load on the server. For example you could store the results
of a time-expensive database query so that it is not required to
run on every page load.

With this in mind caching is not permanent storage and should never
be used to permanently store anything. And only cache things that
can be regenerated when needed.
