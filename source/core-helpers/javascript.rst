7.6 Javascript
--------------

The Javascript helper is used to aid in creating well formatted
related javascript tags and codeblocks. There are several methods
some of which are designed to work with the
`Prototype <http://www.prototypejs.org>`_ Javascript library.

The Javascript Helper is deprecated in 1.3 and will be removed in
future versions of CakePHP. See the new JsHelper and HtmlHelper, as
well as the migration guide for where JavascriptHelper's methods
have moved to.
