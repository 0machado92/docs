7.3 Form
--------

The FormHelper is a new addition to CakePHP. Most of the heavy
lifting in form creation is now done using this new class, rather
than (now deprecated) methods in the HtmlHelper. The FormHelper
focuses on creating forms quickly, in a way that will streamline
validation, re-population and layout. The FormHelper is also
flexible - it will do almost everything for you automagically, or
you can use specific methods to get only what you need.
