Router
######

Router can be used to parse urls into arrays containing indexes for
the controller, action, and any parameters, and the opposite: to
convert url arrays (eg. array('controller'=>'posts',
'action'=>'index')) to string urls.

Read more about ways to configure the Router here:

Router also include other utility methods for dealing with urls.
