3.3.1 Development
-----------------

A development installation is the fastest method to setup Cake.
This example will help you install a CakePHP application and make
it available at http://www.example.com/cake\_1\_3/. We assume for
the purposes of this example that your document root is set to
/var/www/html.

Unpack the contents of the Cake archive into /var/www/html. You now
have a folder in your document root named after the release you've
downloaded (e.g. cake\_1.3.0). Rename this folder to cake\_1\_3.
Your development setup will look like this on the file system:


-  /var/www/html
   
   -  /cake\_1\_3
      
      -  /app
      -  /cake
      -  /vendors
      -  /.htaccess
      -  /index.php
      -  /README



If your web server is configured correctly, you should now find
your Cake application accessible at
http://www.example.com/cake\_1\_3/.
