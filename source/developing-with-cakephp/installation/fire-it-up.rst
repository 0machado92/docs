3.3.8 Fire It Up
----------------

Alright, let's see CakePHP in action. Depending on which setup you
used, you should point your browser to http://example.com/ or
http://example.com/cake\_install/. At this point, you'll be
presented with CakePHP's default home, and a message that tells you
the status of your current database connection.

Congratulations! You are ready to create your first CakePHP
application.

Not working? If you're getting timezone related error from PHP
uncomment one line in app/config/core.php.

::

    /**
     * If you are on PHP 5.3 uncomment this line and correct your server timezone
     * to fix the date & time related errors.
     */
        date_default_timezone_set('UTC');
