3.11.4 Core Helpers
-------------------

CakePHP features a number of helpers that aid in view creation.
They assist in creating well-formed markup (including forms), aid
in formatting text, times and numbers, and can even speed up Ajax
functionality. Here is a summary of the built-in helpers. For more
