3.15 Global Constants and Functions
-----------------------------------

While most of your day-to-day work in CakePHP will be utilizing
core classes and methods, CakePHP features a number of global
convenience functions that may come in handy. Many of these
functions are for use with CakePHP classes (loading model or
component classes), but many others make working with arrays or

directories in your CakePHP application.
