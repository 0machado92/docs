3.6.1 Introduction
------------------

Components are packages of logic that are shared between
controllers. If you find yourself wanting to copy and paste things
between controllers, you might consider wrapping some functionality
in a component.

CakePHP also comes with a fantastic set of core components you can
use to aid in:


-  Security
-  Sessions
-  Access control lists
-  Emails
-  Cookies
-  Authentication
-  Request handling

Each of these core components are detailed in their own chapters.
For now, weâ€™ll show you how to create your own components. Creating
components keeps controller code clean and allows you to reuse code
between projects.
