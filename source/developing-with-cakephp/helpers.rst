3.11 Helpers
------------

Helpers are the component-like classes for the presentation layer
of your application. They contain presentational logic that is
shared between many views, elements, or layouts. This chapter will
show you how to create your own helpers, and outline the basic
tasks CakePHPâ€™s core helpers can help you accomplish. For more
information on core helpers, check out
