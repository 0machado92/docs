3.4 Configuration
-----------------

Configuring a CakePHP application is a piece of cake. After you
have installed CakePHP, creating a basic web application requires
only that you setup a database configuration.

There are, however, other optional configuration steps you can take
in order to take advantage of CakePHP flexible architecture. You
can easily add to the functionality inherited from the CakePHP
core, configure additional/different URL mappings (routes), and
define additional/different inflections.
