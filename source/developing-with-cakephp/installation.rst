3.3 Installation
----------------

Installing CakePHP can be as simple as slapping it in your web
server’s document root, or as complex and flexible as you wish.
This section will cover the three main installation types for
CakePHP: development, production, and advanced.


-  Development: easy to get going, URLs for the application include
   the CakePHP installation directory name, and less secure.
-  Production: Requires the ability to configure the web server’s
   document root, clean URLs, very secure.
-  Advanced: With some configuration, allows you to place key
   CakePHP directories in different parts of the filesystem, possibly
   sharing a single CakePHP core library folder amongst many CakePHP
   applications.
