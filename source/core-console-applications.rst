9 Core Console Applications
---------------------------

CakePHP features a number of console applications out of the box.
Some of these applications are used in concert with other CakePHP
features (like ACL or i18n), and others are for general use in
getting you to launch quicker.

This section explains how to use the core console applications
packaged with CakePHP.

Before you dive in here, you may want to check out the
:doc:`/developing-with-cakephp/the-cakephp-console` covered
earlier. Console setup isn't covered here, so if you've never used
the console before, check it out.
