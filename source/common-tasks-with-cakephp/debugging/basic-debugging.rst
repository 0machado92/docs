4.4.1 Basic Debugging
---------------------

debug($var, $showHTML = false, $showFrom = true)
The debug() function is a globally available function that works
similarly to the PHP function print\_r(). The debug() function
allows you to show the contents of a variable in a number of
different ways. First, if you'd like data to be shown in an
HTML-friendly way, set the second parameter to true. The function
also prints out the line and file it is originating from by
default.

Output from this function is only shown if the core debug variable
has been set to a value greater than 0.
