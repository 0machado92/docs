4.8 Internationalization & Localization
---------------------------------------

One of the best ways for your applications to reach a larger
audience is to cater for multiple languages. This can often prove
to be a daunting task, but the internationalization and
localization features in CakePHP make it much easier.

First, itâ€™s important to understand some terminology.
*Internationalization* refers to the ability of an application to
be localized. The term *localization* refers to the adaptation of
an application to meet specific language (or culture) requirements
(i.e., a "locale"). Internationalization and localization are often
abbreviated as i18n and l10n respectively; 18 and 10 are the number
of characters between the first and last character.
