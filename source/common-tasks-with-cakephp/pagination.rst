4.9 Pagination
--------------

One of the main obstacles of creating flexible and user-friendly
web applications is designing an intuitive UI. Many applications
tend to grow in size and complexity quickly, and designers and
programmers alike find they are unable to cope with displaying
hundreds or thousands of records. Refactoring takes time, and
performance and user satisfaction can suffer.

Displaying a reasonable number of records per page has always been
a critical part of every application and used to cause many
headaches for developers. CakePHP eases the burden on the developer
by providing a quick, easy way to paginate data.

The PaginatorHelper offers a great solution because it's so easy to
use. Apart from pagination, it bundles some very easy-to-use
sorting features. Last but not least, Ajax sorting and pagination
are supported as well.
