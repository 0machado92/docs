4.7.2 Testing overview - Unit testing vs. Web testing
-----------------------------------------------------

The CakePHP test framework supports two types of testing. One is
Unit Testing, where you test small parts of your code, such as a
method in a component or an action in a controller. The other type
of testing supported is Web Testing, where you automate the work of
testing your application through navigating pages, filling forms,
clicking links and so on.
