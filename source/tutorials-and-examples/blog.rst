11.1 Blog

Welcome to CakePHP. You're probably checking out this tutorial
because you want to learn more about how CakePHP works. It's our
aim to increase productivity and make coding more enjoyable: we
hope you'll see this as you dive into the code.

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a simple blog
application. We'll be getting and installing Cake, creating and
configuring a database, and creating enough application logic to
list, add, edit, and delete blog posts.

Here's what you'll need:


#. A running web server. We're going to assume you're using Apache,
   though the instructions for using other servers should be very
   similar. We might have to play a little with the server
   configuration, but most folks can get Cake up and running without
   any configuration at all.
#. A database server. We're going to be using MySQL server in this
   tutorial. You'll need to know enough about SQL in order to create a
   database: Cake will be taking the reins from there.
#. Basic PHP knowledge. The more object-oriented programming you've
   done, the better: but fear not if you're a procedural fan.
#. Finally, you'll need a basic knowledge of the MVC programming
   pattern. A quick overview can be found in Chapter "Beginning With
   CakePHP", Section :
   `Understanding Model-View-Controller </view/10/>`_. Don't worry:
   its only a half a page or so.

Let's get started!
