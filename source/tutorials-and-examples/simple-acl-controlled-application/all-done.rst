11.2.10 All done
----------------

You should now have an application controlled by Auth and Acl.
Users permissions are set at the group level, but you can set them
by user at the same time. You can also set permissions on a global
and per-controller and per-action basis. Furthermore, you have a
reusable block of code to easily expand your ACO table as your app
grows.
