11.1.14 Conclusion
------------------

Creating applications this way will win you peace, honor, love, and
money beyond even your wildest fantasies. Simple, isn't it? Keep in
mind that this tutorial was very basic. CakePHP has *many* more
features to offer, and is flexible in ways we didn't wish to cover
here for simplicity's sake. Use the rest of this manual as a guide
for building more feature-rich applications.

Now that you've created a basic Cake application you're ready for
the real thing. Start your own project, read the rest of the
`Manual </>`_ and `API <http://api.cakephp.org>`_.
