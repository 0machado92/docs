11.1.1 Getting Cake
-------------------

First, let's get a copy of fresh Cake code.

To get a fresh download, visit the CakePHP project on github:
`http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/downloads <http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/downloads>`_
and download the latest release of 1.3

You can also clone the the repository using
`git <http://git-scm.com/>`_.
``git clone git://github.com/cakephp/cakephp.git``

Regardless of how you downloaded it, place the code inside of your
DocumentRoot. Once finished, your directory setup should look
something like the following:

::

    /path_to_document_root
        /app
        /cake
        /plugins
        /vendors
        .htaccess
        index.php
        README


#. ``/path_to_document_root``
#. ``/app``
#. ``/cake``
#. ``/plugins``
#. ``/vendors``
#. ``.htaccess``
#. ``index.php``
#. ``README``

Now might be a good time to learn a bit about how Cake's directory
structure works: check out Chapter "Basic Principles of CakePHP",
