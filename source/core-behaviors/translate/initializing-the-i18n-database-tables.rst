6.3.1 Initializing the i18n Database Tables
-------------------------------------------

You can either use the CakePHP console or you can manually create
it. It is advised to use the console for this, because it might
happen that the layout changes in future versions of CakePHP.
Sticking to the console will make sure that you have the correct
layout.

::

    ./cake i18n


#. ``./cake i18n``

Select ``[I]`` which will run the i18n database intialization
script. You will be asked if you want to drop any existing and if
you want to create it. Answer with yes if you are sure there is no
i18n table already, and answer with yes again to create the table.
