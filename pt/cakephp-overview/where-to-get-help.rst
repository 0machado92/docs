Onde obter ajuda
################

Site oficial do CakePHP
=======================

`http://www.cakephp.org <http://www.cakephp.org>`_

O site oficial do CakePHP é sempre o melhor lugar para visitar. Possui links
para ferramentas frequentemente utilizadas para desenvolvedores, screencasts,
oportunidades de doações e downloads.

O Cookbook
==========

`http://book.cakephp.org <http://book.cakephp.org>`_

Este manual deverá ser provavelmente o primeiro lugar que você vá para obter
respostas. Como acontece com muitos outros projetos de código aberto, temos
novas pessoas regularmente. Tente o seu melhor para responder às suas próprias
perguntas primeiro. As respostas podem vir mais lentas, mas vão permanecer mais
tempo – e também vão oferecer uma ajuda relâmpago. Tanto o manual como a API tem
um componente online.

The Bakery
==========

`http://bakery.cakephp.org <http://bakery.cakephp.org>`_

The CakePHP Bakery is a clearing house for all things CakePHP.
Check it out for tutorials, case studies, and code examples. Once
you’re acquainted with CakePHP, log on and share your knowledge
with the community and gain instant fame and fortune.

The API
=======

`http://api.cakephp.org/ <http://api.cakephp.org/>`_

Straight to the point and straight from the core developers, the
CakePHP API (Application Programming Interface) is the most
comprehensive documentation around for all the nitty gritty details
of the internal workings of the framework. Its a straight forward
code reference, so bring your propeller hat.

CakeForge
=========

`http://www.cakeforge.org <http://www.cakeforge.org>`_

CakeForge is another developer resource you can use to host your
CakePHP projects to share with others. If you’re looking for (or
want to share) a killer component or a praiseworthy plugin, check
out CakeForge.

The Test Cases
==============

If you ever feel the information provided in the API is not
sufficient, check out the code of the test cases provided with
CakePHP. They can serve as practical examples for function and
data member usage for a class.::

If you’re stumped, give us a holler in the CakePHP IRC channel.
Someone from the development team is usually there, especially
during the daylight hours for North and South America users. We’d
love to hear from you, whether you need some help, want to find
users in your area, or would like to donate your brand new sports
car.

The Google Group
================

`http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php <http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php>`_

CakePHP also has a very active Google Group. It can be a great
resource for finding archived answers, frequently asked questions,
and getting answers to immediate problems.
