Core Helpers
############

Helpers are the component-like classes for the presentation layer of
your application. They contain presentational logic that is shared
between many views, elements, or layouts.

This section describes each of the helpers that come with CakePHP such
as Form, Html, JavaScript and RSS.

Read :doc:`/The-Manual/Developing-with-CakePHP/Helpers` to learn more about helpers and how
you can build your own helpers.
