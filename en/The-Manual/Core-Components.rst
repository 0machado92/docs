Core Components
###############

CakePHP has a number of built-in components. They provide out of the box
functionality for several commonly used tasks.

:doc:`/The-Manual/Core-Components/Access-Control-Lists`

The Acl component provides an easy to use interface for database and ini
based access control lists.

:doc:`/The-Manual/Core-Components/Authentication`

The auth component provides an easy to use authentication system using a
variety of authentication processes, such as controller callbacks, Acl,
or Object callbacks.

:doc:`/The-Manual/Core-Components/Cookies`

The cookie component behaves in a similar fashion to the
SessionComponent in that it provides a wrapper for PHP's native cookie
support.

:doc:`/The-Manual/Core-Components/Email`

An interface that can be used to send emails using one of several mail
transfer agents including php's mail() and smtp.

:doc:`/The-Manual/Core-Components/Request-Handling`

The request handler allows you to introspect further into the requests
your visitors and inform your application about the content types and
requested information.

:doc:`/The-Manual/Core-Components/Security-Component`

The security component allows you to set tighter security and use and
manage HTTP authentication.

:doc:`/The-Manual/Core-Components/Sessions`

The session component provides a storage independent wrapper to PHP's
sessions.

To learn more about each component see the menu on the left, or learn
more about :doc:`/The-Manual/Developing-with-CakePHP/Components`.
