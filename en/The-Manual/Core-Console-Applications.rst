Core Console Applications
#########################

CakePHP features a number of console applications out of the box. Some
of these applications are used in concert with other CakePHP features
(like ACL or i18n), and others are for general use in getting you to
launch quicker.

This section explains how to use the core console applications packaged
with CakePHP.

Before you dive in here, you may want to check out the :doc:`/The-Manual/Developing-with-CakePHP/The-CakePHP-Console` covered earlier. Console setup
isn't covered here, so if you've never used the console before, check it
out.
