Basic Principles of CakePHP
###########################

The CakePHP framework provides a robust base for your application. It
can handle every aspect, from the user’s initial request all the way to
the final rendering of a web page. And since the framework follows the
principles of MVC, it allows you to easily customize and extend most
aspects of your application.

The framework also provides a basic organizational structure, from
filenames to database table names, keeping your entire application
consistent and logical. This concept is simple but powerful. Follow the
conventions and you’ll always know exactly where things are and how
they’re organized.
