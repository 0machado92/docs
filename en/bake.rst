Bake Console
############

CakePHP's bake console is another effort to get you up and running in CakePHP
â€“ fast. The bake console can create any of CakePHP's basic ingredients: models,
behaviors, views, helpers, components, components test cases, fixtures and
plugins. And we aren't just talking skeleton classes: Bake can create a fully
functional application in just a few minutes. In fact, Bake is a natural step to
take once an application has been scaffolded.
