Getting Started
===============

Learning a new framework can be intimidating and exciting at the same time. To
help you along, we have created a cookbook packed with examples and recipies to
get the common tasks completed. If you are new, you should start off with the
:doc:`/tutorials-and-examples/blog/blog` as it will give you a quick tour of what
CakePHP has to offer and how it works.

After you've finished the Blog Tutorial, you can brush up on the key elements in
a CakePHP application:

* The :doc:`CakePHP request cycle </getting-started/a-typical-cakephp-request>`
* The :doc:`conventions </getting-started/cakephp-conventions>` that CakePHP
  uses.
* :doc:`Controllers </controllers>` handle requests and co-ordinate your models
  and the responses your application creates.
* :doc:`Views </views>` are the presentation layer in your application. They
  give you powerful tools to create HTML, JSON and the other outputs your
  application needs.
* :doc:`Models </orm>` are the key ingredient in any application. They handle
  validation, and domain logic within your application.
