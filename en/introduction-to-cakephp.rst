What is CakePHP?
================

CakePHP is a free open-source rapid development framework for PHP. Its a
structure of libraries, classes and run-time infrastructure for
programmers creating web applications originally inspired by the Ruby on
Rails framework. Our primary goal is to enable you to work in a
structured and rapid manner - without loss of flexibility.

History of CakePHP
==================

In 2005, Michal Tatarynowicz wrote a minimal version of a Rapid
Application Framework in PHP. He found that it was the start of a very
good framework. Michal published the framework under the MIT license,
dubbing it Cake, and opened it up to a community of developers, who now
maintain Cake under the name CakePHP.
