Helpers
#######

CakePHP features a number of helpers that aid in view creation.
They assist in creating well-formed markup (including forms), aid
in formatting text, times and numbers, and can even speed up Ajax
functionality. Here is a summary of the built-in helpers. For more
information, check out :doc:`/core-libraries/helpers`.

This section describes each of the helpers that come with CakePHP
such as Form, Html, JavaScript and RSS.

Read :doc:`/views/helpers` to learn more about helpers,
their api, and how you can create and use your own helpers.
