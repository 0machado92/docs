Requirements
############

-  HTTP Server. For example: Apache. mod\_rewrite is preferred, but
   by no means required.
-  PHP 4.3.2 or greater. Yes, CakePHP works great on PHP 4 and 5.

Technically a database engine isnâ€™t required, but we imagine that
most applications will utilize one. CakePHP supports a variety of
database storage engines:

-  MySQL (4 or greater)
-  PostgreSQL
-  Microsoft SQL Server
-  Oracle
-  SQLite
