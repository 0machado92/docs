Generación de Código con Bake
#############################

Ya has aprendido sobre scaffolding en CakePHP: una forma simple de armar
una aplicación con sólo una base de datos y algunas clases básicas. La
consola Bake es otro esfuerzo para tener CakePHP corriendo rápido. La
consola Bake puede crear cualquiera de los ingredientes básicos de
CakePHP: modelos, vistas y controladores. Y no estamos hablando sólo de
clases estructurales: Bake puede crear una aplicación completamente
funcional en sólo unos minutos. De hecho, Bake es el paso natural que
toman las aplicaciones una vez que han pasado por la etapa de
scaffolding

Para utilizar Bake necesitar ejecutar el script localizado en el
directorio /cake/console/

::

    $ cd ./cake/console/
    $ cake bake

Dependiendo de tu configuración, podrías necesitar darle permisos de
ejecución al script bash o llamarlo usando./cake bake. La consola de
Cake corre usando PHP CLI (command line interface). Si tienes algún
problema con el script, asegúrate de que tienes PHP CLI instalado y que
además tienes los módulos necesarios habilitados(Ej: MySQL).

Cuando utilices Bake por primera vez, te pedirá que crees un archivo de
configuración para la base de datos, si todavía no creaste uno.

Una vez que hayas configurado la base de datos, cuando ejecutes Bake te
presentará estas opciones:

::

    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    App : app
    Path: /ruta/al/proyecto
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Interactive Bake Shell
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    [D]atabase Configuration
    [M]odel
    [V]iew
    [C]ontroller
    [P]roject
    [Q]uit
    What would you like to Bake? (D/M/V/C/P/Q) 
    >  

Alternativamente, puedes ejecutar cualquiera de estos comandos
directamente de la línea de comandos:

::

    $ cake bake db_config
    $ cake bake model
    $ cake bake view 
    $ cake bake controller
    $ cake bake project

Bake improvements in 1.3
========================

For 1.3 bake has had a significant overhaul, and a number of features
and enhancements have been built in.

-  Two new tasks (FixtureTask and TestTask) are accessible from the main
   bake menu
-  A third task (TemplateTask) has been added for use in your shells.
-  All the different bake tasks now allow you to use connections other
   than default for baking. Using the ``-connection`` parameter.
-  Plugin support has been greatly improved. You can use either
   ``-plugin PluginName`` or ``Plugin.class``.
-  Questions have been clarified, and made easier to understand.
-  Multiple validations on models has been added.
-  Self Associated models using ``parent_id`` are now detected. For
   example if your model is named Thread, a ParentThread and ChildThread
   association will be created.
-  Fixtures and Tests can be baked separately.
-  Baked Tests include as many fixtures as they know about, including
   plugin detection (plugin detection does not work on PHP4).

So with the laundry list of features, we'll take some time to look at
some of the new commands, new parameters and updated features.

**New FixtureTask, TestTask and TemplateTask.**

Fixture and test baking were a bit of a pain in the past. You could only
generate tests when baking the classes, and fixtures could only be
generated when baking models. This made adding tests to your
applications later or even regenerating fixtures with new schemas a bit
painful. For 1.3 we've separated out Fixture and Test making them
separate tasks. This allows you to re-run them and regenerate tests and
fixtures at any point in your development process.

In addition to being rebuildable at any time, baked tests are now
attempt to find as many fixtures as possible. In the past getting into
testing often involved fighting through numerous 'Missing Table' errors.
With more advanced fixture detection we hope to make testing easier and
more accessible.

Test cases also generate skeleton test methods for every non-inherited
public method in your classes. Saving you one extra step.

``TemplateTask`` is a behind the scenes task, and it handles file
generation from templates. In previous versions of CakePHP baked views
were template based, but all other code was not. With 1.3 almost all the
content in the files generated by bake are controlled by templates and
the ``TemplateTask``.

The ``FixtureTask`` not only generates fixtures with dummy data, but
using the interactive options or the ``-records`` option you can enable
fixture generation using live data.

**New bake command**

New commands have been added to make baking easier and faster.
Controller, Model, View baking all feature an ``all`` subcommand, that
builds everything at once and makes speedy rebuilds easy.

::

    cake bake model all

Would bake all the models for an application in one shot. Similarly
``cake bake controller all`` would bake all controllers and
``cake bake view all`` would generate all view files. Parameters on the
``ControllerTask`` have changed as well.
``cake bake controller scaffold`` is now
``cake bake controller public``. ``ViewTask`` has had an ``-admin`` flag
added, using ``-admin`` will allow you to bake views for actions that
begin with ``Routing.admin``

As mentioned before ``cake bake fixture`` and ``cake bake test`` are
new, and have several subcommands each. ``cake bake fixture all`` will
regenerate all the basic fixtures for your application. The ``-count``
parameter allows you to set the number of fake records that are created.
By running fixture task interactively you can generate fixtures using
the data in your live tables. You can use
``cake bake test <type> <class>`` to create test cases for already
created objects in your app. Type should be one of the standard CakePHP
types ('component', 'controller', 'model', 'helper', 'behavior') but
doesn't have to be. Class should be an existing object of the chosen
type.

**Templates Galore**

New in bake for 1.3 is the addition of more templates. In 1.2 baked
views used templates that could be changed to modify the view files bake
generated. In 1.3 templates are used to generate all output from bake.
There are separate templates for controllers, controller action sets,
fixtures, models, test cases, and the view files from 1.2. As well as
more templates, you can also have multiple template sets or, bake
themes. Bake themes can be provided in your app, or as part of plugins.
An example plugin path for bake theme would be
``app/plugins/bake_theme/vendors/shells/templates/dark_red/``. An app
bake theme called ``blue_bunny`` would be placed in
``app/vendors/shells/templates/blue_bunny``. You can look at
``cake/console/templates/default/`` to see what directories and files
are required of a bake theme. However, like view files, if your bake
theme doesn't implement a template, other installed themes will be
checked until the correct template is found.

**Additional plugin support.**

New in 1.3 are additional ways to specify plugin names when using bake.
In addition to ``cake bake plugin Todo controller Posts``, there are two
new forms. ``cake bake controller Todo.Posts`` and
``cake bake controller Posts -plugin Todo``. The plugin parameter can be
while using interactive bake as well.
``cake bake controller -plugin Todo``, for example will allow you to use
interactive bake to add controllers to your Todo plugin. Additional /
multiple plugin paths are supported as well. In the past bake required
your plugin to be in app/plugins. In 1.3 bake will find which of the
pluginPaths the named plugin is located on, and add the files there.
